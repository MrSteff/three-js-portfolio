        <h1>üìú Timeline</h1>
        <h2>My first degree</h2>
        <p>
          I think it's safe to discard the unimportant history, thus I'll tell you about the best moments that I've lived in regards to learning and working. <br> <br>
          The first time I recall I had fun in this field was in my first degree, It was very interesting to learn how many branches technology has, from networking vlans to building pcs to setting up domains and learning how to automate tasks with excel and other microsoft softwares was very interesting and very eye opening to the opportunities.

        <h2>My first internship</h2>
        <p>
          Later on I got my first internship with the help of my school, at that internship I requested to learn as much as I can about pc hardware, how to fix or how to understand most hardware and any jobs available related to it. <br>
          Even tho the tasks I did there were varied, between setting up pc with an OS from their local server and testing if they work well to extracting any components from any discarded boards, besides repairing any pc we could I also had the task to perform mechanical destruction on several HDD which was... entertaining.

        <h2>My second degree</h2>
        <p>
          After that I continued my studies for another 2 years on the branch most related to Programming, there I've learned and worked quite a lot, I didn't even know if I could handle all the workload we had the first year. <br>
          Nonetheless I managed to finish the year in my first attempt and learned a whole lot and very quickly, some of the things we learned include: <br>
          SQL, PL/SQL, what modifiers to add to queries, how to display them well formated, and generally how to get all the data needed from complicated databases, also creating methods (PL/SQL) for databases to store and to use in queries to extract information more easily. <br>
          Basic programming in JAVA with the later addition of connecting it to a database MySQL, here we learned from basic calculations to displaying different designs on the console and then making our very own program with graphics while working in a group with other classmates and also learning the different ways to organize ourselves and also how to program in a way that is understandable for anyone else and for ourselves as well. <br> 
          HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, XML Schema restriction and declaring elements, here we learned to make our first page and how to add programming to it, how to easily recover data from it and how to connect it to a program or a database, with the help of this course I am able to create this page you're reading right now and with the help of some online tutorials (if you're interested here's the link: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7AOvWpIVHU">Build a 3D Portfolio Website with Three.js Beginner‚Äôs Tutorial</a>) <br>
          On the second year we learned to program mobile apps with android studio where we had the challenge to make a weather app for pc and mobile by reading public weather studio json files for each city. <br>
          We learned to program in VB.net where I made my favorite program so far, we had the challenge to make a program that would read an access file and I had too much fun with how easily I could find the necessary elements in that language, so I went the extra mile and added unrequired features <br>
          We also learned to program from the excel programming option VBA.

        <h2>Where I'm at</h2>
        <p>
          When finishing the last year of my second degree we had the choice to choose what project we want to make while doing the internship (read further down for more info on the project)
          I went ahead to my first internship where I'm still working currently as noted on my CV as well, here I learned how to create new products that we get petitioned, how to help clients with various issues and overall group organization and workflow.

        <p>
          Before I go ahead and mention the projects I've made while I was in my degree I have to mention that these are mostly in Spanish. <br>
          With that said, onto the mentions.

        <h2>Plan a school project</h2>

        <p>
          The most noticible project that I've had to do during my first degree was to setup a fully functional system to use in a school setting.<br><br>
          
          We had to make a budget for each computer and item in the classroom, install the server controlling all computers/devices of students
          and plan how to install the network and how to configurate it. <br><br> 
          
          We had to find the safest way to set up a network and set up each router with each device in 
          packet tracer program, I'll link the packet tracer projects here, for someone that knows how this works I'm hoping s/he will be proud to see such a safe
          network setup. <a href="Plano Clases Infantil.pkt">First class type for kindergarden age class</a>, <a href="Plano Clases Primaria.pkt">Second type for slightly older kids</a>, and <a href="Nuevo Plano de red del centro.pkt">the setup of the whole center</a>.<br>

        <h2>Bus ticket Project</h2>

        <p>
          In this project, we had to create a program that would allow us to visualize all the available bus stations, view available spaces for the certain time and date
          and the price of said ticket, also the ability to buy said ticket.<br> <br>

          We had to create the database however all the data was given to us by the teachers.<br>

          Here's a preview of how it works and what it ended up looking like: <a href="Bus ticket video.mkv">video</a> <br>
          Pretty basic for the first year but very much needed in order to grasp if someone understood how to build such a project.<br><br>

          In every project we were obligated to work in groups of 2-3 members and being the case my team decided to distribute the various windows to each member
          so that we can learn to connect the work of one to the other.

        <h2>Notes mobile app</h2>

        <p>
          This was our first ever project that we had to develop solely for mobile, it's a simple notes app but it does not connect to any database, it only 
          creates local files and stores data into those, and we get to choose how we approach the format of each file and how it should work with the app.<br> <br>

          Being the first project obviously is pretty messy unlike the previous project, but I decided I'd leave the problems and bugs for show as well because after all we all have projects 
          that have lots of bugs and others that we've polished more.<br>

          Here's a preview of how it works and what it ended up looking like: <a href="Notes app.mp4"> video </a> <br>
          Very basic stuff once more, and I will not lie, comparing development in android studio to developing an app in java with eclipse is a very different 
          experience, one has lots and lots of pre-built options and templates and all that while the other doesn't, it leaves you to start from scratch.<br><br>

          It was a great deal of fun either way and I'm glad we got to learn so much.

        <h2>Euskal Weather app</h2>

        <p>
          Onto the last project of the year... sort of.<br> <br>

          We were tasked with the creation of a weather app based on public json files with data from different weather stations.<br>

          Here's a preview of how it works: <a href="euskalWeather app.mp4"> video </a> <br>
          As usual we were in groups of 3 and each were assigned different tasks, I was mostly in charge with formatting the... dare I say awful json file for use in
          the program.<br><br>

          I had my work cut out for me with trying to format that file, and I barely got to help with other sections of the project like creating a panel designing it and whatnot. <br><br>

          We also had to make a pc version for both windows and linux, I will not showcase that part mainly because we did not have enough time in the school year to
          polish all parts of this project.<br> <br>

          Also I'd like to mention a nice little fact about this project, we were at the end of the year, so when we got back from holidays the app wouldn't work anymore. <br>
          The reason being that the link would change since it modified the year of when it was pulling data from, so at that moment I had decided to adapt it to yearly change,
          if they follow the same link structure as before, it will always be updated.<br> <br>

          This was such a big project and very short on time, so it was pretty stressful overall, but we came through Nonetheless.

        <h2>Work detecting program project</h2>

        <p>
          When we started our last part of the school year, the internships, we were tasked with obviously doing the internship but at the same time develop
          a project of our choice for presentation. <br><br>

          Our choice was to make a PC program that would track how long you've had certain programs on for, this would help you create an estimate of how long you
          usually work on a task, and also had a feature to create a bill with a designated hourly cost.<br><br>

          Since we as startup programmers would often not manage to accurately give an estimate to our work, we thought it would be a wonderful idea to have a program
          that could help us figure out how long it usually takes us to finish a task or a project.<br>
          In order to not undervalue our work and time.<br><br>

          Thus the "CTT" project was born, and this is how it works and what it looks like in early stages: <a href="CTT program.mkv">video</a><br>

          The reason why this is made in vb.net will be explained in the next project highlight.<br><br>

        <h2>Favorite project</h2>

        <p>
          We had many more projects to do than the ones mentioned above, those were smaller or maybe not as significant, or not teaching us as much as the ones
          mentioned.<br>
          But I'd like to point out one particular project that I personally loved, we were assigned to make a program in vb.net that would do certain things with 
          data from an access database, this was not a group project but an individual one. <br><br>

          I loved the way vb.net makes its templates and how you're able to call back variables and objects from said template, the layout of it made me fall in love 
          with this programming language and during this specific project I went a few extra miles away from what was the minimum requested. <br><br>

          Unlike the previous projects, I will link this one entirely for you to try out, you will need to install visual studio for it to work and just in case you don't feel like it
          I also link here a short video of what it is and how it works. <a href="AccessDBRead.zip"> access reader program</a>.<br><br>

          As mentioned before, it's a access database reader and editor, it displays data, filters and manipulates it to a certain degree, now, as many things this one also has 
          some limitations such as in adapter mode you cannot edit the data because there's something that doesn't let the program modify the access file, and there's some features 
          in vb.net that are an enigma on how they work or how should be set up. With that said, here's the video <a href="accessReader.mkv">view video</a>.
